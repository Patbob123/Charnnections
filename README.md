## Inspiration

I was playing TFT last night until 3am after coming back from the workshop and opening ceremony. I got so mad because I keep losing to Bilgewater Ryze with all their TRAITS, so I went and played connections instead. Then, a spark, I got something, and no, I'm not talking about the diarrhea I was about to have, it was connections, but with characters. Why characters? Well, recently, my roommate got obsessed with powerscaledle, a game where you have to choose the strongest between two fictional characters. He played it tirelessly before his MAT237 test instead of studying, so, to further hinder his productivity, I created Charnnection. (pronouced kehr-nek-shn)

## What it does

Rips off NYT connections.

## How we built it

Me and my team (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude AI and Deepseek) used incredible NEVER SEEN before technologies such as...Javascript, MongoDB, and even the Google Gemini API. (oh and the API for the set of characters were is Jikan v4)

## Challenges we ran into

I keep spilling instant noodle packets all over my stove, and also I can't believe I got food poisoning from UofTHacks. >:(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I did the connections puzzle today in less than 20 seconds sleep deprived (from playing TFT) only to find out it was rated 1.7/5 difficulty.

## What we learned

Maybe it was all about the connections we made along the way.

## What's next for Charnnections

un-weebify it

## Is this bad for my digital footprint?
